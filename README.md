# Real Time System -2023
In this work, we were asked to perform some task scheduling exercises and Measurement of the computation time of these tasks. Using only POSIX, with the Real-time, and configured to run on only 1 core, we were able to configure the tasks to run in a staggered manner and we can see if the tasks meet their time goal.
If the task doesn't meet its time target, we say there's a glitch in the system.
