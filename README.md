# Real Time System -2023
Work#1
In this work, we were asked to perform some task scheduling exercises and Measurement of the computation time of these tasks. Using only POSIX, with the Real-time, and configured to run on only 1 core, we were able to configure the tasks to run in a staggered manner and we can see if the tasks meet their time goal.
If the task doesn't meet its time target, we say there's a glitch in the system.

Work#2
In this work, the goal is to develop a C/C++ program to solve a problemrelated to perception based on environmental sensors, specifically, a ground/road detection system using data from a 3D LiDAR sensor. The work is divided into three parts, the first two of which involve POSIX routines routines implemented in C, in order to ensure that several threads performing sequential tasks do not read/write data simultaneously in the same variable. The third part requires the use the ROS (Robot Operating System) framework[2] and the programming languages used will be C/C++. The overall aim is to apply these concepts and technologies in the context of autonomous driving and mobile robotic navigation.
